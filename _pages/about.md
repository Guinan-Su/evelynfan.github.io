I am currently an Applied researcher at Tencent. Before that, I was a software engineer in Microsoft Azure ML Team. I received my Master degree in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2020.

<!-- under the supervision of [Prof. Taku Komura](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/taku), [Prof. Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping) and [Prof. Ping Luo](http://luoping.me/). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2017. I have served as the Program Committee and Reviewer for a variety of conferences such as NeurIPS, CVPR, ECCV, SIGGRAPH and AAAI, and journals such as International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), Artificial Intelligence (AI), IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, IEEE Signal Processing Letters and Neurocomputing.-->
